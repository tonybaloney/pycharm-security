<h1>TRY100</h1>
<p>Use of a <code>try</code> ... <code>except</code> block where the except block does not contain anything other than comments and a <code>continue</code> statement is considered bad security practice.</p>
<p>Whilst an attacker may be trying to exploit exceptions in your code, you should, at the very least, log these exceptions.</p>
<p>Some runtime errors that may be caused by insufficient permissions should not be allowed to continue control flow, and should stop execution of the program.</p>
<p>This will only apply to the generic explicit <code>Exception</code> except type, or an empty except type.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is bad</p>
<pre><code class="python">try:
    do_things
except Exception:
    # do nothing!
    continue
</code></pre>
<p>This is also bad</p>
<pre><code class="python">try:
    do_things
except:
    # do nothing!
    continue
</code></pre>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fix the reason why the exception occurs</li>
  <li>Consider using a <code>raise from</code> statement</li>
  <li>Add logging to the except blog</li>
</ul>
